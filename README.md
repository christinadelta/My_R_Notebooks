# My R Notebooks

A personal repo with notebook tutorials about anything and everything that is R related. 

For simplicity, in all the notebooks I will be using the same dataset (or datasets). 

## ANOVA contrasts 

At least one notebook tutorial that will explain with examples what contrasts are in factorial analyses and why they are important. 

## Hypothesis testing 

## Bayesian statistics with R and the stan package
